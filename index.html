            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>The name is Brick... Samuel Brick</h2>
            <p>It is tempting to pursue a mysterious persona, but I'm honestly a very simple creature.</p>
            <p>When I am not trying to think of interesting ways to describe myself, I'm spending time with my family
                and pets, listening to calming ambient music, and trying to figure out how computers work.</p>
            <p>I'm also into reading fantasy books, picking up slightly heavier weights, and learning extra human
                languages!</p>

            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <h2>Software Learning</h2>
            <p>For the past few years, I have been trying to learn more about how the web and software works.</p>
            <p>Turns out its pretty interesting stuff, so I have been trying to make some fun projects and enter the
                software development field!</p>
            <h3>The Odin Project</h3>
            <p>After graduating from high school and dealing with the lockdown from COVID, I was trying to find new
                things to fill my freetime and decided I wanted to make a website.</p>
            <p>It didn't take long for me to feel a bit overwhelmed from a few google searches on the topic, so I looked
                for a resource that broke up the
                process into more managable parts for me. That resource ended up being The Odin Project.</p>
            <p>Following along with its extensive (at least in my opinion) curriculum, I was able to make a handful of
                small projects that helped me get a good grasp of the basic processes involved in web development.</p>
            <p>While I still want to finish the full stack curriculum offered on its website. I like to think the
                progress I've made so far has allowed to be a dangerous player in the webdev game.</p>
            <p>Dangerous to myself at least.</p>
            <h3>Inkhollow</h3>
            <p>With all the material I learned from The Odin Project and other resources, I got antsy and started making
                a website called Inkhollow.</p>
            <p>My plan for this website is pretty simple. I want to make a digital library that people can use to read
                if they have difficulty accessing books by more conventional means.</p>
            <p>I'm really excited about it because I plan on testing out a concept of voluntary ad exposure. Unlike a
                majority of other content-sharing platforms, my goal will be to avoid passive ad exposure and instead
                make it possible for readers to actively choose to view ads in order to support authors they enjoy.</p>
            <p>I have no clue how it will actually turn out, but I'm really curious if such an approach could offer a
                nicer experience for people that like to read online.</p>
