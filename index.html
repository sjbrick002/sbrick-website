            <h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
            <p>I'm a very simple creature.</p>
            <p>When I am not trying to think of interesting ways to describe myself, I'm spending time with my family
                and pets, listening to relaxing ambient music, and figuring out how computers work.</p>
            <p>I also really enjoy reading fantasy books, picking up slightly heavier weights, and learning new
                languages!</p>

            <h2>Learning Software</h2>
            <p>For the past few years, I have been learning more about how the web and software in general works.</p>
            <p>Turns out it's pretty interesting stuff, so I have been making some fun projects in order to enter the
                software development field!</p>

                <summary>The Odin Project</summary>
                <p>After graduating from high school in 2020, I was finding
                    new things to fill my freetime and decided I wanted to make a website.</p>
                <p>It didn't take long for me to feel a bit overwhelmed from a few google searches on the topic, so
                    I looked for a resource that broke up the process into more managable parts. That resource
                    ended up being The Odin Project.</p>
                <p>Following along with its expanding curriculum, I was able to make a
                    handful of challenging projects that helped me get a good grasp of the basic processes involved in
                    web development.</p>
                <p>While I'm still finishing the full stack curriculum offered by the Odin Project, I think
                    the progress I've made so far has allowed me to become a much more competent player in the webdev
                    game.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Inkhollow</summary>
                <p>With all the material I learned from The Odin Project and other resources, I got an itch to make
                    something completely separate from any of its assignments and started making
                    an original website called Inkhollow.</p>
                <p>My plan for this website is pretty simple. I want to make a digital library that people can use to
                    read if they have difficulty accessing books by more conventional means.</p>
                <p>I'm really excited about it because I plan on testing out a concept of voluntary ad exposure. Unlike
                    a majority of other content-sharing platforms, my goal will be to avoid passive ad exposure and
                    instead make it possible for readers to actively choose to view ads in order to support authors they
                    enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>I have no clue how it will actually turn out, but I'm really curious if such an approach could
                    offer a nicer experience for people that like to read online.</p>
                <p>Inspiration for this project comes from the itch.io and drivethrurpg platforms. Each site have
                    pay-what-you-want features for their products, which gives users control over how they choose to
                    support the service.</p>
